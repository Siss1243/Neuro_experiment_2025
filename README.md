# EEG-Mismatch Detection in Cognitive Tracking

This repository contains the stimulus code and relevant documentation for our EEG experiment investigating mismatch detection during object tracking. The experiment was developed in PsychoPy and designed as a visual oddball paradigm with dynamic motion stimuli.

## üß† Experimental Design

Participants track a moving DVD-logo across a screen. The logo occasionally disappears (1.5s occlusion) and then reappears either in a predictable or unpredictable position and trajectory. 

The code implements:
- Continuous motion and wall-bounce behavior
- Controlled occlusion and trajectory violation logic
- Parallel port triggers for EEG synchronization
- Attention check prompts
